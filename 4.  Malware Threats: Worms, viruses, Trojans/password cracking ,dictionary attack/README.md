# Password Cracking and Dictionary Attacks Explained

## What is Password Cracking?

Password cracking is the process of **recovering passwords** from data stored in or transmitted by computer systems. It's typically done:
- For **legitimate purposes**: Security testing, recovering forgotten passwords (by authorized users)
- For **malicious purposes**: Unauthorized access to systems, data theft, or identity theft

## Dictionary Attack: The Most Common Method

### Core Concept
A **dictionary attack** tries passwords from a pre-compiled list of likely passwords, rather than trying every possible combination (brute force).

### How It Works
1. **Create/Obtain a Wordlist**: Lists of common passwords, phrases, words from dictionaries, previously leaked passwords
2. **Hash Generation**: Convert each word in the list to its hash (using the same algorithm the system uses)
3. **Comparison**: Compare generated hashes with stolen/obtained password hashes
4. **Match Found**: When hashes match, the plaintext password is discovered

### Simple Example
If the system stores password hashes like this:
- `password123` → `482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38`
