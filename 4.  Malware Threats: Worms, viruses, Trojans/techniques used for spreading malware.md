  * **Windows:** PowerShell, WMI, BITSAdmin, certutil, msiexec
  * **Linux/Unix:** Cron jobs, SSH keys, bash scripts, systemd services
  * **Cross-platform:** Python, Docker, Git, cloud CLIs

### **Fileless Malware Techniques**
* **Memory-Only Execution:** Malware that never touches disk
* **Registry Persistence:** Storing payloads in registry keys
* **WMI Event Subscription:** Using WMI for persistence and execution
* **Process Hollowing:** Creating legitimate processes then replacing their memory

### **Privilege Escalation Exploitation**
* **Kernel Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting drivers or OS kernel bugs
* **Service Misconfigurations:** Unquoted service paths, weak permissions
* **Token Manipulation:** Using `SeDebugPrivilege` or similar

---

## **6. Cloud & Modern Infrastructure Techniques**

### **Container & Orchestration Attacks**
* **Malicious Docker Images:** In public registries like Docker Hub
* **Kubernetes Misconfigurations:** Exposed dashboards, weak RBAC policies
* **Serverless Function Abuse:** Malicious Lambda/Cloud Functions

### **Cloud Service Exploitation**
* **Compromised APIs/Keys:** Stolen cloud access keys
* **Resource Hijacking:** Using cloud instances for cryptomining or C2 servers
* **Shared Responsibility Model Exploits:** Assuming "cloud provider handles security"

### **SaaS Application Abuse**
* **OAuth Token Theft:** Compromising cloud application permissions
* **App Marketplace Malware:** Malicious add-ons/plugins for services like Slack, Teams

---

## **7. Mobile-Specific Techniques**

### **App Store Manipulation**
* **Repackaged Legitimate Apps:** Popular apps with added malware

## **The Infection Chain: A Modern Example**

```
1. Initial Access: Spear phishing email → Malicious OneNote attachment
2. Execution: User enables content → PowerShell downloads payload
3. Persistence: Scheduled task created → Registry modification
4. Discovery: Network scanning → Active Directory enumeration
5. Lateral Movement: Pass-the-hash → WMI remote execution
6. Collection: Data staging on internal server → Compression/encryption
7. Exfiltration: DNS tunneling → HTTPS to cloud storage
8. Impact: Deploy ransomware across network → Encrypt + exfiltrate data
```

## **Why These Techniques Work: The Attacker's Advantage**

1. **Asymmetry:** One vulnerability can affect millions
2. **Automation:** Tools can probe thousands of systems per minute
3. **Anonymity:** Cryptocurrency, Tor, bulletproof hosting enable anonymous operations
4. **Economics:** Low cost to attack, high cost to defend
5. **Human Factor:** People remain the weakest link despite technology

## **Key Insight**

Modern malware rarely uses just one spreading technique—it employs **multiple, layered approaches** (a "kill chain") to maximize success probability. The most effective campaigns combine **technical exploitation** with **psychological manipulation**, often starting with the easiest method (phishing) and escalating to more technical methods (lateral movement) once inside.

**The evolution continues:** As defenses improve, attackers shift to new techniques—currently moving toward **abusing legitimate tools**, **cloud services**, and **AI-enabled attacks** while maintaining the classic human exploitation vectors that remain consistently effective.
