# wappalyzer

Wappalyzer identifies technologies used on websites, such as content management systems (CMS), web frameworks, JavaScript libraries, analytics tools, and more.
​

## Key Features

It detects over a thousand technologies by analyzing HTML, response headers, JavaScript variables, and URL patterns using regular expressions. Browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and apps for Mac/iOS provide easy integration, with regular updates for new detections.​

## Usage in Cybersecurity

Penetration testers use Wappalyzer for reconnaissance to fingerprint target sites, revealing CMS like WordPress or tools like analytics trackers that may indicate vulnerabilities. Open-source versions on GitHub (e.g., tomnomnom/wappalyzer) allow CLI usage for automated scanning in Kali Linux environments.
​
## Availability

Access it via the official site for lookups and APIs, or install extensions/apps for on-demand analysis.
