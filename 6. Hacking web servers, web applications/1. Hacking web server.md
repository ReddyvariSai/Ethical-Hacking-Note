# Hacking Web Servers


A web server works behind the scenes to give you the contentyou want when you access a website like Google, Facebook,or your college homepage on your browser.Think of a web server like a server at a restaurant.The web server sends you the proper dish, the online content,when you, the browser, make an order, a request.Web servers are what make websites operate.Now, let's see some common components of web servers.Several essential parts of a web server help to manage websites,keep files organized, and respond to requests correctly.The document root is the initial component.The document root is the main directory of the web serverwhere all website files are stored, including HTML pages,CSS, images, and scripts.This directory contains the files the web server needs to displayfor the web page in the browser.
