Kali Linux is a Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security.

The software is based on the testing branch of the Debian Linux Distribution: most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian repositories.

 Kali Linux has gained popularity in the cybersecurity community due to its comprehensive set of tools designed for penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and reverse engineering.

It was developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the rewrite of BackTrack, their previous information security testing Linux distribution based on Knoppix.

Kali Linux was featured in multiple episodes of the TV series Mr. Robot.

## Requirements

Kali Linux requires:

1. A minimum of 20GB hard disk space for installation, depending on the version. Version 2020.2 requires at least 20GB.

2. A minimum of 128 MB of RAM, 2 GB if opting to use the Xfce4 interface

3. A CD-DVD drive, USB stick or other bootable media.

## Comparison with other Linux distributions

Kali Linux is developed with a focus towards cyber security experts, penetration testers, and white-hat hackers. There are a few other distributions dedicated to penetration testing, such as Parrot OS, BlackArch, and Wifislax. Kali Linux has stood out against these other distributions for cyber security and penetration testing as well as having made distinct design decisions such as the default user being the superuser before its policy change in 2020.1 and later.
 

## Kali Purple

It features its own suite of tools sorted into categories that correspond to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Kali NetHunter

Kali NetHunter, an official Android-based penetration testing platform, expands Kali’s capabilities, allowing penetration testing from Android devices, providing features like wireless frame injection and MITM attacks.

It was the first open source Android penetration testing platform for Nexus devices, created as a joint effort between the Kali community member "BinkyBear" and Offensive Security. It supports Wireless 802.11 frame injection, one-click MANA Evil Access Point setups, HID keyboard (Teensy like attacks), as well as Bad USB MITM attacks.
