# How to install Brave on Linux
21 September 2025 by Egidio Docile
Brave is a free and open source web browser focused on providing a privacy-oriented setup by default. It is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, and it is based on chromium, which is also the open source foundation upon Google Chrome is built.  Brave comes with useful built-in features such an ad-blocker, a private search engine, an integrated VPN, and Tor support.

In this tutorial we learn how to install Brave on the most used Linux distributions, using native packages or as a flatpak.

### In this tutorial you will learn:

* How to install Brave on Debian-based distributions
* How to install Brave on Fedora-based distributions
* How to install Brave as a flatpak

## Installing Brave on Debian-based distributions

Brave provides official repositories for both Debian and Fedora-based distributions. To add the Brave repository on a Debian system, all we have to do is to write its definition in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory. We just need to run the following command:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main"| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

```
See the “signed-by” notation between square brackets in the repository definition? That is the path of the GPG key used to sign the repository packages. To install it on our system, we can simply use Curl:

```
$ sudo curl -Lo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

```
Finally, we can synchronize the repositories and install the “brave-browser” package:

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y brave-browser
```

## Installing Brave on Fedora and Fedora-based distributions

To install Brave on Fedora and Fedora-based distributions, we first need to add the official rpm repository to our favorite distribution software sources. We can do it by using dnf:

```
$ sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://brave-browser-rpm-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser.repo

```
The command will download the file into the /etc/yum.repos.d directory. Now, just as we did for Debian-based systems, we need to add the Brave GPG key used to sign the packages to the “rpm” package manager keyring:

```
$ sudo rpm --import https://brave-browser-rpm-release.s3.brave.com/brave-core.asc
```

At this point, we can simply install Brave as we would install any other package:

```
$ sudo dnf install brave-browser

```

## Installing Brave as a flatpak

Using flatpaks we can install Brave, together with its dependencies, in a sandboxed environment. To use this distribution-independent installation method, as a first thing, we need to install the flatpak utility itself. On Fedora, and other distributions of the Red Hat family, we can run:

```
$ sudo dnf install flatpak
```

On Debian and Debian-based distributions, instead:

```
$ sudo apt install flatpak
```

We can now add the Flathub repository as a software source. We can do this system-wide, so that it is usable by all users, or just for ourselves. The former is the obvious solution if all users need to access the browser; the latter has the advantage of not requiring elevated privileges, and can be handy if we are the only user on the system, or we lack said privileges. In this case, we will perform a system-wide installation (performing a user-level installation is just a matter of launching the commands below without “sudo”, and with the --user option).

To add the flathub repository, we run:

```
$ sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

Once the repository is available, we can install Brave by running:

```
$ sudo flatpak install -y flathub com.brave.Browser
```

Once installed, the Brave desktop launcher may not be immediately visible in the applications menu launcher. To update it, we can run:

```
$ xdg-desktop-menu force-update

```
# Conclusions

In this tutorial we learned how to install the Brave browser on Linux. We saw how to add the browser official repositories to Fedora and Debian-based distributions and how to perform a distribution-independent installation using the flatpak technology. To know more about the Brave, you can visit the browser official website or take a look at the project repository on Github.
